Here is my inline equation $A=B$. \( E=m_2 \times c ^{\tau \times a} \). 

\[ E=m_2 \times c ^{\tau \times a} \]



\begin{math}
    E=m_2 \times c ^{\tau \times a}
\end{math}

\section{somethin}

In physics, the mass-energy equivalence is stated 
by the equation $E=mc^2$, discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein.
\begin{math}
    E=m_2 \times c ^{\tau \times a}
\end{math}
